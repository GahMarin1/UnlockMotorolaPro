auto USB bootloader unlocker via TERMUX

hey, welcome to my creation 
I made this script because i've seen people failling on unlock bootloader on bugjaeger, So I thought, what if i made my own tool for automatic unlocking? (This program was created to unlock the Motorola's bootloader. Remember that if you don't receive the activation password from Motorola, this is not a problem with the tool but with the legality of your phone.) 

HOW TO DOWNLOAD IT? 


1.
``pkg update && pkg upgrade``

2.
``pkg install wget -y``

3.
